5.Let's say you want about 30 hardware modules to communicate with each other. 
There is one STM32 microcontroller on each module, and the modules can be removed and installed instantly.
Which communication standard would you use for these modules to communicate effectively with each other? Why?

Can bus communaciton. Becase you can add device or remove device from the system anytime. All device can communicate each other.
Always you can add device to system. You dont need master-slave system. For example you want to add the display in your car. 
You can add and set up easily. Because canbus give you this chance.

4.Let's assume that there is a hardware module that is attached to the motherboard with a mezzanine connector.
Due to the small form factor, the number of pins on the mezzanine connector is much less than the number of pins you need. 
Assuming that the communication speed is not important, how would you solve this problem?

 we can use pin expander. So we have lots of gpio.
 We can use mux to read the datas.
 It is necessary communicate from gpio pins.
